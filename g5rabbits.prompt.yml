      ## 🎯 **GraphQL-Neural-Hypergraph-Membrane Cognitive Singularity
      Implementation**


      **Objective**: Implement a **self-organizing cognitive membrane** that
      unifies GNN, DAS, ESN, P-System, and ECAN through GraphQL as the universal
      cognitive protocol, solving the frame problem through nested tensor
      membranes.


      **Total Degrees of Freedom**: 776 quantum states  

      **Prime Factorization**: 2³ × 97 (8 × 97 = fundamental octave × prime
      singularity)  

      **Implementation Timeline**: 39 days (3 × 13 = trinity × transformation)
